# Part 2

Once you can load cars into the Ferry, look at other things the Ferry company is interested in:

* knowing how many cars of a certain color are on the Ferry;
* updating the people and car counts correctly when a car leaves the Ferry;
* giving a car 50% discount after three trips on the same ferry. The board method should return 'half price!';
* giving a free trip after 7 trips on any Ferry. The board method should return 'you go free!'
