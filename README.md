# Ferry Kata

## Instructions

Solve the Kata below using TDD. Complete it in Javascript, Python, or Ruby. Once done in one Language in the alotted time try it out in another. Use flowcharts and diagrams to think through the required logic.

## Part 1

In an island country far far away there are lots of Ferries that allow people to travel easily by car between all the different islands of this country.

This country's government would like to control the number of cars and people that can get onto a Ferry.

To help them they need you to:

* Create a `Car` class: the constructor should specify the **colour** and  the **number of passengers** in the car.

* Create a `Ferry` class: the constructor should specify the **number of cars** allowed on the ferry and also **how many people** are allowed on the ferry.

Cars are allowed onto the Ferry using the `board` method. If the ferry is not full yet the `board` method returns 'accepted'. If there are enough people or cars on the Ferry already, the `board` method should return 'rejected'.

The Ferry class instance should keep track of the number of people and cars on the Ferry using the `people_count` and `car_count` properties.

## Part 2

Once you can load cars into the Ferry, look at other things the Ferry company is interested in:

* knowing how many cars of a certain color are on the Ferry;
* updating the people and car counts correctly when a car leaves the Ferry;
* giving a car 50% discount after three trips on the same ferry. The board method should return 'half price!';
* giving a free trip after 7 trips on any Ferry. The board method should return 'you go free!';
* offering a new service: paint jobs. A car on the ferry can change colour using the paint method.
* letting people move between cars during the journey. People can switch cars using the move method.

## Code Coverage

Code coverage tells you how much of your code is covered by your tests. Higher code coverage can mean your code has a good chance of being well-tested and contain few bugs.

Let's use a tool called [Instanbul](https://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/) to check our code coverage.

### Istanbul

Install Istanbul globally like this:

```
$ npm install -g istanbul
```

To run Istanbul's coverage calculation with your mocha tests, run:

```
istanbul cover _mocha
```

Instanbul generates a web page of the detailed results of its calculations to `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`. Look at this page to see which particular bits of your code aren't being covered by your tests.
